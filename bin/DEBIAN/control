Description: Builds and runs Dockerfiles in one command
 dockerscript is a cli docker plugin which enables execution of Dockerfiles
 via a single "docker script" command. This command builds an image, then
 starts a container with that image and attaches to it via a tty.
 .
 For example, "docker script from ubuntu" starts an instance of ubuntu, since
 "from ubuntu" is a valid Dockerfile.
 .
 You could pass a link to Dockerfile or directory containing it to this
 command, e.g. "docker script /path/to/my/Dockerfile"
